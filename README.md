# integer-openssl

Implementation of the `GHC.Integer` type using the OpenSSL BIGNUM arbitrary size
integer library contained in `libcrypto`.

## **WARNING** Work in progress

Currently this is a proof of concept and only some of the `Integer` functions
are implemented. If things work out, this would be a free BSD-licensed
alternative to the LGPL-licensed `integer-gmp` - used by default in GHC - with
performance significantly faster than `integer-simple` - a BSD-licensed
Haskell-only integer library.

The test suite gives a rough estimate in what is currently implemented as each
function is checked against the builtin library. First benchmarks indicate a
10-20% performance hit against `integer-gmp` but significant speedup compared to
`integer-simple`:
